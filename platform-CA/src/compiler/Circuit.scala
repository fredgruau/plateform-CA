/**
 * Analysed by the compiler to produce a CA rule, a circuit is implemented like a function definition:
 *  parameter corresponds to external generated fields input to  the CA
 *  they must be present in the memory, before the main loop is called.
 * return results are fields produced by the CA, to be used by an host.
 * they are in the memory after the main loop is called.
 * Normally, it is the caller which decides where the result of the main are stored,
 * however, for the main, we can suppose the offset of Data Param starts at Zero.
 * the main's signature and those compiled offset must be accessible from the host.
 * We imagine that another compiler towards 1D can be used to do the interface: produce the 2D input and read the 2D output, on the border
 * both 1D and 2D compilation can be linked, as far as offset computation goes.
 * In turns, the 1D CA takes input output fields produced by the host, on a single cell (or on four corners)
